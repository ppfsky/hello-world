## introduction
my name is **petra**. i am a *beginner* in github. the reason for i join in github is i am self-studying python and i am also interested in other programe tools or web design. i really want to create my own interactive web.
## what i learned before 221005
well, i knew some basic knowledge of python. i already can clean data or create plots but they all takes time. yeah, i am still not good at.
